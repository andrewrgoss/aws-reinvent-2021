## Introduction to AWS Lambda

### Overview
The lab provides a basic explanation of AWS Lambda. It will demonstrate the steps required to get started to create a Lambda function in an event-driven environment.

AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you, making it easy to build applications that respond quickly to new information. AWS Lambda starts running your code within milliseconds of an event such as an image upload, in-app activity, website click, or output from a connected device. You can also use AWS Lambda to create new back-end services where compute resources are automatically triggered based on custom requests.

### Topics Covered
By the end of this lab you will be able to:

* Create an AWS Lambda function
* Configure an Amazon S3 bucket as a Lambda Event Source
* Trigger a Lambda function by uploading an object to Amazon S3
* Monitor AWS Lambda S3 functions through Amazon CloudWatch Log
